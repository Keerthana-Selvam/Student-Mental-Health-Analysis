# Student Mental Health Dynamics and Treatment Outreach
Analyzing and Improving Mental Health Support Among Students Using Data-Driven Insights

# Overview
This project explores the mental health trends of students, identifying key factors affecting their well-being. Through Power BI dashboards, geospatial analysis, and statistical insights, this research uncovers disparities in mental health across genders, academic performance, and college years. The findings aim to inform educators, policymakers, and mental health professionals on proactive interventions to support student well-being.

# Key Findings
This study utilizes Power BI, Excel, and statistical methods to derive actionable insights from student mental health data. Below are the major highlights:

1. Gender Disparity in Mental Health
75% of reported mental health issues come from female students, suggesting gender-specific stress factors.
Male students are less likely to seek professional help, indicating potential underreporting of issues.
2. Mental Health Decline Through College Years
Year 1 students reported higher well-being than those in later years.
By Year 4, mental health issues had increased significantly, likely due to academic pressure and career uncertainties.
3. Academic Performance & Mental Health
Students with higher CGPA (3.5 - 4.0) reported fewer mental health issues.
Those with a CGPA below 2.5 struggled more with mental health concerns, indicating a possible correlation between academic stress and well-being.
4. Courses Most Affected
Engineering and BCS (Bachelor of Computer Science) students reported the highest mental health challenges due to coursework intensity.
Psychology and Law students reported lower levels of mental health issues, possibly due to greater awareness and coping mechanisms.
5. Seeking Mental Health Care
Younger students (ages 18-20) were more likely to seek professional help, while older students avoided it.
Cultural and social stigmas may prevent some students from accessing mental health support.
