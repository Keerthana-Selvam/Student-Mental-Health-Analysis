## **Key Findings**
This project integrates advanced data visualization techniques to identify critical insights into student mental health challenges. Below are the major highlights:

### **1. Gender-Based Mental Health Trends**
   - **75% of students experiencing mental health issues are female**, highlighting a gender disparity in mental well-being.
   - **25% of reported cases** are male students, indicating that mental health concerns affect all genders but with different prevalence.

### **2. Mental Health Decline Through College Years**
   - **Sharp decline** in mental well-being from **Year 1 (43 cases) to Year 4 (8 cases)**.
   - Possible causes: **increased academic pressure, social stress, and career concerns**.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Implement early intervention strategies in **first-year students** to prevent long-term mental health deterioration.

### **3. Academic Performance & Mental Health**
   - Students with a **higher CGPA (3.50 - 4.00)** report **fewer mental health issues**.
   - **Lower CGPA (0.00 - 2.49)** students show significantly higher mental health struggles.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Academic support programs, mentorship, and counseling services can help students balance academic pressure and mental well-being.

### **4. Courses Most Affected by Mental Health Issues**
   - **Top 3 Courses** reporting the highest mental health concerns:
     - **Biomedical Sciences**
     - **Engineering**
     - **Business Computing Systems (BCS)**
   - **Actionable Insight**: Introduce **mental health awareness programs** tailored for high-stress courses.

### **5. Seeking Mental Health Care Among Students**
   - A large number of students **do not seek mental health support**, despite experiencing issues.
   - **Younger students (ages 18-20)** are less likely to seek help compared to older students.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Improve accessibility to mental health services and awareness campaigns targeted at younger students.

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
   - **Raw Data Cleaning**:
     - Removed missing values and standardized categorical variables.
     - Merged duplicate records to ensure accuracy.
   - **Feature Engineering**:
     - Created new metrics for **mental health severity scores**.
     - Categorized students by **academic year, course, and age group**.

### **2. Data Visualization in Power BI**
   - **Interactive Filters**:
     - Users can explore **mental health trends by gender, academic performance, and course**.
   - **Heatmaps & Line Charts**:
     - Show trends in **mental health decline over college years**.
   - **Bar Graphs & Pie Charts**:
     - Illustrate **gender disparities and treatment-seeking behaviors**.

### **3. Tools Used**
   - **Power BI**: For visualization and dashboard interactivity.
   - **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
